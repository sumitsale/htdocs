<Press_News_Content><p><strong>Your Birthday?</strong><br />30 October.</p><p><strong>Your first break in the music scene?<br /></strong>Anand and Anand- RD Burman</p><p><strong>You have been in the music scene for so long and been as successful in films as well as non-films. What is more fulfilling?</strong> <br />It used to be Bollywood music.</p><p><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />I see no market for non-film music to be hits, even film music gets markets only in case of caller tunes and mobile revenues.</p><p><strong>Why have you taken the digital approach? <br /></strong>I believe that if songs sung by me for Bollywood Films can become big hits as Caller Tunes or Ringtones, why should I not give it a try with music that has my creative freedom to create it for my fans.</p><p><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com?</strong> <br /><strong>Gul chand sitare ho na ho </strong>- The lyrics of this song picture a broken heart with a sweet melody making it very relatable as well as listenable.</p><p><strong>Chandni ki Palki Main </strong>- The song on its own has a mix of styles that also takes you into the sounds of the 70s which were more into swing and melody. The lyrics is a dedictaion to beauty.</p><p><strong>Zara Zara in Gesuuon ko Suljhane Do </strong>- The pace of the song is very foot tapping and the treatment to the song makes it very fantasy like. The intro piece in the song is the hook that lingers on long after the song is complete. A sudden end to the song makes you wish there was more.</p><p><strong>If you were not a singer, what would you have been? --</strong> Music Director</p><p><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor</strong> &ndash; Kishore Kumar</p><p><strong>You Like </strong>- Mirror ;) myself</p><p><strong>You Dislike&nbsp;-</strong> Hypocrisy</p><p><strong>Singer </strong>- Me</p><p><strong>Musician</strong> - Manvari&rsquo;s song</p><p><strong>Song</strong> - All Kishore Kumar and RD Burman song.</p><p><strong>Your trademark</strong> - My voice and my spectacles</p><p><strong>Your message to your fans</strong><br />Keep on listening to me. I promise to give new everytime you hear. </p><p><strong>Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com</strong><br />Digital is the present and the future. The opportunity of being able to be part of a musical revolution in the digital space which is already in its overdrive was tempting and wants to try this unconventional route to release unreleased music for my fans.</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><p>A brand new season of little champ is back in little different format. </p><p>An age old debate between girls and boys to prove the superiority will now exchange blows musically. Veteran singers and judges on the show Abhijeet Bhattacharya and Alka Yagnik have formed their teams of boys and girls respectively. </p><p>Melodious Alka expresses her excitement, &ldquo;A different kind of thrill is experienced when there is a clash between girls and boys in any kind of competition. </p><p>It will be the USP of this season&rdquo;. But Abhijeet maintains, &ldquo;Though we have formed a team, for us the contestant is not a girl or a boy. We will purely be judging them on their ability&rdquo;.</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Title>Today most singers seem clone to each other: Abhijeet</Press_News_Title>
<Press_News_Date>2008-06-28</Press_News_Date>
<Press_News_Source></Press_News_Source>
<Press_News_Content><p>After judging Little Champs and Star Voice of India, the renowned singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya is all set to preside over yet another reality show Ek Se Badkar Ek on Zee TV. Here he speaks out in a free wheeling interview on this new format of the show and the ill that plague the genre&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is different about Ek Se Badkar Ek?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>This unique show is a fusion of singing and dancing. But I am concerned only with the 8 singers. Since the contestants have already arrived from previous reality shows, it&rsquo;s not a talent hunt as for now. It&#39;s not also about whether they are good or bad singers. The matter, only counts, is how they sing on any particular day. I will not be swayed by emotions or by excuses that their throat was bad. If you are bad on a particular day you are bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t you think reality shows have been done to death?</strong></p><p><br />The public is liking them right, so what&rsquo;s the problem? Having said that it&rsquo;s better than the never ending sas-bahu drama&rsquo;s, where each woman is having 4 affairs and number of illegitimate children, we at least show true talent getting their space in the sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is the fusion, you have mentioned, exciting enough?</strong></p><p><br />Yes, if the singer is bad then the actor will have to do the extra bit in his dance to save the day. Neither Ahmed nor me will try to save any bad couple. We have our reputations to protect. I can assure you that in this show the views of the judges and audience will always be the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You seemed unhappy with Voice Of India, hence you stayed away from the finale?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>I had some previous engagement in the States, which I could not cancel. But I was not happy with the elimination of Toshi and Abhas as well. Plus, the presence of one clone of Kumar Sanu was troubling me a lot. And what was the use of attending the final and sitting like mute spectators!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The winner Ishmeet was your favourite, yet once you attacked him and said that he should go out&hellip;</strong></p><p><br />That was my strategy. For, after my attack, he was inundated with votes from Punjab, while I got lots brickbats. I felt I had to do something to prevent a good natural singer from going out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Something similar had happened in Little Champs as well.</strong></p><p><br />A lot of sympathy votes were going to Diwakar as because he was blind. I opposed that and eventually the dark horse Sanchita started to get ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your take on SMS voting&hellip;</strong></p><p><br />It&#39;s needed to retain audience interest. And it&#39;s not all that SMS based shows mint money; only a few do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What about judges fighting among themselves?</strong></p><p><br />It used to happen earlier as well but then it would be edited. Now things are reverse edited. This drama started when singers, who did not have much work, started becoming judges on reality shows. What further annoys me is the fact that you have actress who can&rsquo;t speak Hindi properly judging such shows. A pop singer is totally ruining a classical number and you are praising him/her. Only a singer should judge such shows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Singers coming to the forefront through such format&hellip;</strong></p><p><br />Yes, agreed. Singers have become very popular but there is a flip side as well. Today most singers seem clones of each other. There are a few, even on this show, who I will never encourage. Earlier each singer had his own distinct style which is not available in these shows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your take on them not doing playback?</strong></p><p><br />Honestly speaking, I am not too gungho about the current playback scene. No effort is taken these days to make sure that the singer&rsquo;s voice fits the actor. Any nonsense singer is taken. Mind you, I am not talking about the composition or the lyrics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Since you are coming up with your new album, are you not afraid of piracy?</strong></p><p><br />Many other revenues streams have opened up, like royalties from FM stations and ring tones etc. Agreed, piracy is a major issue but all the loss accrues to the music company. Even if these losses are plugged we singer&rsquo;s will not get an extra paisa, so why should we bother!</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Title>Aishwarya Majmudar - High on Woman Power</Press_News_Title>
<Press_News_Date>2009-11-02</Press_News_Date>
<Press_News_Source>Tribune India</Press_News_Source>
<Press_News_Content><p><strong>OF late, it&rsquo;s been raining reality shows. So, why another story on the finalists of a singing contest?</strong> </p><p>Well, simply because Chhote Ustaad is the only show where two girls have made it to the finals. Bubbling with fizzy endorphins on their feat, we catch hold of the two lil&rsquo; girls and quiz them about their love for singing, dreams and women power!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Their initial inaccessibility for a telephonic interview is, no doubt, irksome. However, our &lsquo;stars-in-the-making&rsquo; have quite a &lsquo;spring in their voices&rsquo; when they finally greet us over the phone. It&rsquo;s perhaps their chirpy eagerness to make it big, which lets all irritation melt away. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so we throw a clich&eacute;d volley of queries at Aishwarya Majmudar, busy rehearsing for Chhote Ustaad&rsquo;s grand finale on Saturday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aishwarya seems particularly delighted because of her favourite Amitabh Bachchan&rsquo;s presence at the recently shot promo shoot for the finals. &ldquo;Amit uncle&rsquo;s too cute! He noticed that I was wearing a shirt too large for my size and immediately adjusted my collar, saying Ye mera shirt aapko kisne de diya.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jokes apart, their mommies-in-tow have been quite a support system post the grilling rounds. Says&nbsp;Aishwarya Majmudar, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tensed about studies. My school in Ahmedabad has already promoted me to class X. But yes, a lot of hardwork is involved for this contest too. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are doing five hours of riyaaz daily, besides a 2-3 hour choreography class and shoots. I guess it&rsquo;s the price for success! With sparkling confidence, moms-in-tow and well-rehearsed statements, these girls seem lil&rsquo; stars indeed. Maybe, Big B wasn&rsquo;t exactly joking when he whispered to the show&rsquo;s camera person &ldquo;These are stars of today, hum to junior artist hain.&rdquo;</p></Press_News_Content>

Ritesh with his poems, Rahul and Sanjay with guitars, vocals and composing and Aneeta again with vocals and later with percussions also.&nbsp; We would spend hours together, sometimes even days and nights. We would eat, sing, wander, quarrel and resolve, gossip, ponder and dream together. We came to Pune sometime around November of 2005, Amit joined us here. Talaash is a beautiful sense of sharing. With the passage of time we became a family, and then a band.&nbsp; </p><p>You all were based in Lucknow and have a strong Hindi foundation. Do you believe that that is required to sing in Hindi?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that way only you get to feel the minute nuances of the language and then be able&nbsp; to express better. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your song is very acoustic. Do you prefer playing unplugged or wired up?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Surely unplugged, as it suits to our simple music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have performed the world over. Do you prefer performing live or recording in the studio?&nbsp; <br /></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Performing live is always a preference, you have the spontaneous connectivity. But as we&nbsp; ought to record a creative piece in a studio, we try our best to tap the similar feel of&nbsp; expressions, as in a live performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com ? </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Both the songs are nostalgic:</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mohalla</strong> is about the boundless warmth and affection we&nbsp;enjoyed with our neighbours. There are some words or phrases in the song signifying the&nbsp; typical architecture of the houses where we stayed for long. But the very essence of this mohalla (the song) is not limited to a certain part of the land, it is spread all over&nbsp; the country, may be across the world. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Patang</strong> is a passionate sport with no age bar. It is so beautiful and vivid. We have tried to&nbsp; cover almost all the emotions and colours, from flying to crying. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor for the Band</strong> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inspiration has always been the family and friends. They kept expressing their interest and faith in our work since the very beginning and through all the ups and downs and the odds of life they have always stood by us. And when we think of a mentor we know that the band owes a lot to Sri. Promod Shanker of Delhi, late A.K.Gargory (dadu), Sri Vinod Chattrerjee, Ustad Gulshan Bharti, late A.R. Basu&nbsp; (ICCR), Prof. Ruprekha Verma (Ex. VC, Lucknow University), Dr. Sabra Habeeb and Dr. P.K.

<Press_News_Content><p>Asha Bhosle&rsquo;s grandson is as unique as the way he writes his name.</p><p>Chin2 Bhosle of the Band of Boys gets chatty:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Seems like you&rsquo;ve been missing from action for sometime.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s not true. We&rsquo;ve just been out of the media limelight. It&rsquo;s a lot tougher now because the media is all about films these days. Indie-pop is relegated to a very sorry state of affairs. But we&rsquo;re doing really well in the college circles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There have hardly been any boy bands in India when it comes to pop&hellip;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a tough thing to do. We were formed in 2001 and everybody pulled out of their jobs. For one year we were jobless. We&rsquo;ve seen tempers, fighting, problems at home, and that bonded us very together. It&rsquo;s tough to form a band and keep it together&hellip; and that&rsquo;s why the few pop bands that are formed, ultimately break up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What inspires your music?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My inspiration is just music. I can&rsquo;t be a model&hellip; or an actor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Being Asha Bhosle&rsquo;s grandson must have its share of pressure&hellip;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was never any pressure to begin with because I didn&rsquo;t take up music as a profession. I did my MBA&hellip; worked in an ad agency for two years where they made a 15-day break sound like a favour. When I finally quit, she [Asha Bhosle] was like, &lsquo;Are you mad? It&rsquo;s not easy making your way in the music industry.&rsquo; But I told her that I was lucky to have her surname and didn&rsquo;t want any help unless I really asked for it. So I shunned that pressure from the very start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are you doing for New Year&rsquo;s Eve?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be in Delhi performing at Daffodils, Chattarpur on the 31st. I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to celebrate it&hellip; it&rsquo;s a complete high to perform in the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s next?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve recorded a solo album in which I&rsquo;ve sung a song with my grand mom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the one thing that sets you apart from the rest of the band?<br /></strong></p><p>I ride a cycle, wear chappals, shorts and a vest to parties even though my friends have repeatedly asked me to &lsquo;look cool.&rsquo;</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><p>Dhwani, a Kalyan-based rock band is touching the right notes to draw suburban music lovers to an alien dance floor. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Riding high on the warm reviews of their first two stage performances the band is all set to launch their first album online. Ek Ladki&hellip;, Tere Bina&hellip; and Tandav their first few compositions would be now available on the mouse click.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />&nbsp;<br />Last month the band made performed at the Acharya Atre auditorium and the Subhedarwada ground. &ldquo;Suburbs are prepared to absorb pure rock. We have begun with fusion wherein we serve the audience with rock in a desi platter,&rdquo; said Mayuresh Kelkar composer-cum-guitarist of the band. He however assures that one can expect some real head-banging material from the troupe in the New Year. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nestled in the calm locales of Godrej Hill is their newly opened digital studio. It is therefore not surprising when Ashish Tiwari, support vocalist and lead singer for QUE tracks claims that their music is inspired from nature. &ldquo;This very inspiration helped in naming the band,&rdquo; adds Tiwari. Dhwani signifies sound. &ldquo;Dhwani stands for sound that connects body, mind and soul,&rdquo; he further explains.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, the troupe also plans to go mobile on their music. Ringtones of the first album will also be available on the web. &ldquo;A ringtone is the best way to cater to a niche audience. Every phone call can spread our music amongst people,&rdquo; added Kelkar. Meanwhile, these young musicians also have to face the music of a strict 9-5 work schedule, sometimes even more erratic. &ldquo;Our jobs keep us occupied throughout the week. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weekends are exclusively for music,&rdquo; chuckles Kelkar. He further adds, &ldquo;We work for the stomach and jam for peace&rdquo;. Busy switching to the soft rock and classical opt Kelkar feels that the band has ideal balance to change suburban rock culture. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chandrashekhar the lead vocalist, also heard on All India Radio (A.I.R) is the dark horse of the troupe. Ashish accompanies him with vocals while Snehal (Tabla), Bipin (Drum) and&nbsp; Mangesh (guitarist) make the ideal recipe for some peppy soul-stirring music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />On the quest for the young suburban rocker for couple of years, the band wants to bring rock in the mainstream music gallery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Source>IMR</Press_News_Source>
<Press_News_Content><p><strong>IMR: Hello CHANDRESH! So first of all on behalf of Team IMR, thanks for taking the time to talk to us. Tell us about DOL, after playing Live for so many years how you came up with the idea of DOL?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DOL:</strong> Well, about 4 years back Suraj happenend to call me for a one of show and that&rsquo;s how we started jamming. We realized that both of us had the same creative urge and wanted to start a band that only played originals. So we started writing songs and recorded our first album HUMAN RACE. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: How was the response for the album HUMAN RACE as two of your songs were aired on VH1? Is the music scene same as it was before 10 years?</strong></p><p><br /><strong>DOL: </strong>The response has been phenomenal! People sing our songs and request our songs at our gigs. The song being aired on Vh1 gave us an additional boost. The music scene has definitely changed. The audience has become a lot more open to bands playing originals and a lot of smaller venues have opened up. So it no more happens that 50 bands are vying for that one slot in a year!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: What does DREAM OUT LOUD try to speak through their music &amp; lyrics? As on one side we have song like ITS RAINING NOW and on other side we have heavier song like HUMAN BEINGS.</strong></p><p><br /><strong>DOL :</strong>Well this might sound clich&eacute;d but we write about what we feel our experiences, emotions etc. So if we feel that the subject of the song requires a mellow arrangement then that&rsquo;s how it turns out to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: Tell us about your upcoming 2nd Album, what it is all about?</strong></p><p><br />DOL:Its called A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS and we are still in the stage of finalizing what tracks go in there. Although I must say It has been a great leap for us creatively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: Your new songs give a different feel, its heavier and technical as compared to HUMAN RACE, is DOL undergoing a genre change?</strong> </p><p><br /><strong>DOL:</strong> Yeah we are pretty much finding our sound and we are able to express the subject matter a lot more creatively as I said earlier. We don&rsquo;t really think about the genre while writing songs and leave it upto the people to decide what they want to categorize it under!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: Tell us about the song SOUTH INDIAN BOY, as you guys play it live but its not there in the Album? What was the idea behind this song, as the audiences really enjoy this song? </strong></p><p><br /><strong>DOL</strong>: The song was written about Suraj&rsquo;s cousins Father. In an orthodox family music is always looked down upon especially ROCK. So the song talks about what the father feels when he has a son who is rocker! And the song is a funny take on the same... Most youngsters connect with this subject as they go through that almost every other day! The song dint fit into the human race album as the album was very serious and now since there is a huge demand for the song it may be released as a single soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: Your favorite song from the Album, the song you enjoyed the most while composing and which is nearest to the style of music you play?</strong></p><p><br /><strong>DOL:</strong> Well the songs from the new album that have shaped up very well are LABYRINTH, FEET BACK ON THE GROUND.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: I always keep hunting for great bands/records. Please recommend a few that have influenced you or the band as a whole?</strong></p><p><br /><strong>DOL:</strong> Our main influences have been WHITESNAKE, EXTREME, STEVE VAI, JOE SATRIANI, DREAM THEATRE, SEAL, STING.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: Our reader would really appreciate if you would like to tell us something about your website </strong><a href="http://www.theguitarthing.com/"><strong>www.theguitarthing.com</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p><p><br /><strong>DOL:</strong> I have been teaching personally for a long time now &amp; I always wanted to have a website where I could put up a few lessons and that&rsquo;s how it all began. The lessons are such that it would help a Guitar player who has stagnated and is looking for a few tips and ideas pertaining to different styles. Now I get a lot of people who want to learn from me once they go through the website. I hope to do a few more videos and put it up in the future. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMR: DOL is really doing great, would you like to give any message to our readers?</strong></p><p><strong><br />DOL:</strong>Thank you for saying so!! One line - Follow your Dream and work hard to achieve it!!</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Title>EK in Interview</Press_News_Title>
<Press_News_Date>2009-11-02</Press_News_Date>
<Press_News_Source>MyBand.co.in</Press_News_Source>
<Press_News_Content><p><strong>Let me ask you some typical interview questions. How and when did you form your Band &ldquo;Ektheband&rdquo;?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>The name of the band is actually &lsquo;Ek&rsquo; and this name came about in a hurry when we had to register for our first live gig and didn&rsquo;t have a name J .&nbsp; Shashank just thought of the simplest name he could think of and registered us. But in retrospect, and also coincidently, it signifies the very elements of our music, i.e. simplicity and at the same time, varied level of interpretations and subtle complexities. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /><strong>Which singer in Indian music do you admire most? Who is the most favourite Rock Icon?</strong></p><p>A lot of them. All the members have different choices ranging from kishore kumar, KK, Shanker Mahadevan, to SP Balasubhramaniam.&nbsp; <br />We have a lot of favorites when it comes to rock music. Some of them : <br />Pink floyd,<br />The Beatles, <br />The Porcupine tree</p><p><br />Myband: As you say &ldquo;simplicity is the ultimate sophistication&rdquo; &ndash; how do you maintain it or work on it practically while composing a new number, its music arrangement and its rhythm? <br />Ans: We don&rsquo;t &lsquo;try&rsquo; to maintain this saying as such. But yeah it invariable comes into our work as we all believe that simple music is the most heart felt . Yes, musical brilliance is not always about a highly complex and technically challenging composition. It&rsquo;s more about how we incorporate subtle yet complex bits into the songs. A good song should be catchy, but at the same time rich musically. This is what good music is all about and we hope we can continue to get better at it as we go along</p><p>Myband:<br />Is there any meeting point between pure Indian classical music and Western rock music?<br />Ans: The meeting point is music itself. You can listen to varied genres, styles etc of music but in the end the basics remain the same and music of any kind will always be based on the different combination of&nbsp; the basic 12 notes.&nbsp; </p><p><br />Myband:<br />Fusion between Indian classical or semi-classical music and acoustics of western music (for exemple your &ldquo;Darbari Jam&rdquo;) enriches both the forms mutually or it just a way to popularize classical music for mass appeal &ndash; what do you think ? <br />We are definitely not here to promote any particular genre of music. While it is true that some of our songs enrich both forms of music, it is truly our passion for good music that has brought us here. No other ulterior motives&hellip;..seriously!<br />But yes. It does &lsquo;popularize&rsquo;( through we are too small to do that )&nbsp; Indian classical music and we are glad it does, as there&rsquo;s no other form of music that richer that Indian classical music.</p><p>Myband:<br />Which genre will you call for your song &ldquo; Kya yeh sach hai&rdquo; ? This particular song can be a mainstream Hindi song .<br />Ans:- Yes it can be a mainstream hindi song and we don&rsquo;t see that as being an issue. While we want to play in the fusion/rock space, mainstream songs like these add that extra colour to our set list and we are cool with that.</p><p><br />Myband:<br />Do you all think that Shashank, the vocalist gets the most attention of the audience? <br />Ans: It is that Lead Vocalist gets the most attention in a Band as he has the responsibility of connecting with the audience. We have no problems with that as we are here just to play good music. Though we do feel sorry for the bachelors on the band who are probably more deserving from a you-know-what standpoint!!</p><p><br />Myband:<br />How do you practice everyday? Jointly or individually ? Does Shashank, your vocalist practice &ldquo;riwaz&rdquo; of&nbsp; Indian classical music e.g. Khayal, sargam and taan ?<br />Ans: Certain secrets should never be disclosed : Baba Aveer ( guitarist Ek )</p><p>Myband:<br />In your team members, who conceives a new number first? Who writes the lyrics and how do you tune it? I mean it is a team work from the beginning or after the song is composed other members like guitarist and drummer add their portion of it?<br />Ans: Someone comes up with a tune and we kind of start building on it. Any new song will get refined along the way and we are constantly bettering even some of our well known compositions and it is a truly evolutionary process.</p><p><br />Myband:<br />How difficult it is to compose songs after songs keeping the pressure of popularity of the would-be song in mind? I think this is critical and difficult.<br />Ans: Its not. We create the way we feel it. We don&rsquo;t compose music keeping a particular audience in mind. That&rsquo;s why we say, We are EK and this is what we play. </p><p>Myband:What are your gigs in coming few months ?&nbsp; <br />Ans: We are actively playing in the Bangalore music circuit now. Most recently we played at Bangalore Central, KYRA and Opus. We do have a show coming up at Purple Haze.</p><p><br />Myband:<br />When do you have plan to release your own album?<br />Ans: Well, an album is really for bands who want to be in the &ldquo;been there, done that&rdquo; category. Commercially speaking, albums are not viable anymore, but from a band profile standpoint an album to our name will definitely help. So we are not ruling this out yet, but we do not have immediate plans though.</p><p><br />Myband:<br />Do you want to take up music as profession ? <br />Ans: Yes, The thing that we love to do most of all is Music and it would be a boon to do it full time.</p><p>Myband:<br />Do you all jointly as a team chase any specific dream? How do you want to place &ldquo;Ektheband&rdquo; after another 5 years?</p><p>Ans: Other than a few more strands of grey hair on all our heads, I hope nothing changes and we are still together as a band. Of course, we want to be a household name by then and this goes without saying. And more than that, continue creating good music . </p><p>Myband:<br />One last question, you have the chance to give one piece of advice to the young and new rock bands from India. What would it be?<br />Ans: Strengthen your basics and do not follow trends but create your own trends. Explore Indian heritage. Keep on rocking and go after your passion and the whole world is your stage&hellip;cheers!</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Title>Himani Kapoor talks about her music, her life and controversies</Press_News_Title>
<Press_News_Date>2009-11-02</Press_News_Date>
<Press_News_Source>Daily</Press_News_Source>
<Press_News_Content><h5 align="center">HIMANI KAPOOR</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a city that shoulders the formidable tag of making dreams come true, Mumbai sure has been lucky for the Faridabad-born Himani Kapoor. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At 20, she has already been a Sa Re Ga Ma Pa finalist, anchored Antakhsari, and has a handful of films to her credit. She says the reality show helped her get some exposure and also brought her to Mumbai, a city that broadened her outlook. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This helped her bag the opportunity to host Antakshari with Sunil Pal. But after misunderstandings between Pal and Himani, Pal was replaced with Karan Oberoi. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview, Himani spoke to us about the misunderstanding with Sunil Pal, her relationship with Vineet Singh and her upcoming projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Which projects do you have in hand?</strong></p><p><br />Since my voice is heavy, I am singing a wedding song in Bachna Ae Haseeno with Sukhji (Sukhwinder Singh) and Shekhar Ravjiani. I am also singing an item song for Bipasha Basu in an Abbas-Mustan film called Mr Fraud. I have to thank Aadesh Srivastava for all these projects though. Through him I got to sing in Chingaari. Because of that, Himesh Reshammiya asked me to sing in movies like Fool and Final and Aap Ki Khatir.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You entered Bollywood after participating in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. Tell us about your journey?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>It has been a great journey. I still remember standing in the queue for the auditions. It was a long journey and it took a lot of time, but it was worth it. I was upset after I lost in the final, but it was a good opportunity. The show also allowed me to experience Mumbai&rsquo;s culture, which I think is very positive. It changed my outlook on life. As far as my singing is concerned, the show really helped me improve.</p><p><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Aadesh Srivastava was your mentor. How was it working with him?</strong></p><p><br />Everyone on his team received a lot of support from him. He not only coached us by telling us how to modulate our voices, but also helped us pick the right songs. In spite of his busy schedule, he made time for us. He really wanted us to succeed. He also pointed out the finer points, which only trained ears notice. We felt honored that such a big music director was guiding us.</p><p><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>How was it being the host of Antakshari?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>I initially wondered whether I should become an anchor. But it is a music-related show and music is what I want to be a part of, so I felt it was the right move to make. I had a lot of fun anchoring the show with Sunil Pal.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s great to have been a part of such an iconic show; it gave me a lot of confidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us about the problem with Sunil Pal.</strong></p><p><br />I know there was this whole thing in the news about how the two of us didn&rsquo;t get along. But that&rsquo;s not completely true. The media just blew it all out of proportion. There was no major misunderstanding. Sunil bhaiyya was very busy with other shows while we were shooting for Antakshari and because of that he was a bit unprepared. Sometimes he would forget his lines and so I would say them for him to save time. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t like that and so he said that I was stealing his lines. But there was nothing more to it. </p><p><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>There are rumours that you are seeing Vineet Singh. What do you have to say about this?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>This is just loose talk. Whenever you enter the industry and get close to someone, you get linked with him. Vineet and I are just good friends. There were rumours about Karan Oberoi and me too, but the whole world knows Karan is seeing Mona Singh. So, I have learnt to ignore these rumours.</p><p><br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />Are reality shows real?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>Whatever happened in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa was real. The success of this show made other channels start talent shows. I think controversies increase TRPs and this is what makes the show different from the others. In Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, because people said Vineet and I were going around, the TRPs were high already.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What kind of music do you listen to and whom do you idolise?</strong></p><p><br />I love listening to ghazals and Sufi songs. Though my style is Western, I enjoy Sufi songs the most. I idolise Lataji and Ashaji.</p><p><br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />When do you do your riyaaz? </strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>I do my riyaaz every day for one hour. They say it&rsquo;s best to do it in the morning. If I don&rsquo;t have time for it in the mornings, I do it at any time in the day.</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Title>Manasi Scott - While the Music lasts</Press_News_Title>
<Press_News_Date>2009-11-10</Press_News_Date>
<Press_News_Source>AGagl</Press_News_Source>
<Press_News_Content><h5 align="center">Manasi Scott</h5><p><strong>Your Birthday</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>31st December </p><p><strong>Your first break in the music scene</strong></p><p><br />Live performance at a Hemant Trevedi show, Femina Chrysallis. The whole industry was present, especially those who gave work, I did a good job, Bombay Times supported me via a beautiful article written by Martin Dcosta and it was smooth sailing from here on! </p><p><strong>You are one of the most versatile entertainers in the industry who has built her name through live shows much before releasing an album. How have you achieved that?<br /></strong></p><p>Through my faith in God and in realizing that He is the best manager one can ever hope for! My career has really been a series of miracles and I learnt early on to just do my best and leave the rest to God!!</p><p><strong>You are now getting into acting. Do you feel this will work better for you as a singer or is it just another feather in the cap?</strong></p><p>Everything I do in the entertainment industry is with a view to promote my music and me as a singer. I have acted before, theatre, serials, but music is my first love and I do believe to be a complete entertainer you must be able to present yourself and your music interestingly and here acting, comparing, modeling, all help tremendously.</p><p><strong>You have composed, written and sung the songs that you are releasing through this platform. Do you feel it is easier to sing one&rsquo;s own compositions or when someone else composes for you?</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>I believe you know your own compositions better than anyone else and end up giving them more time, more of yourself and more effort, hence they may turn out better overall. The only place it really works for me to have composed the song I have sung is when I am shooting a video because here, knowing the song better than anyone else can really help you emote it the way it needs to be shown.</p><p><strong>Why have you taken the digital approach?</strong> </p><p>Everything has become digital! No one buys cds the traditional way in a store - except die-hards like me who still like to OWN the hard copy, own a bit of the artiste this way. It&rsquo;s an exciting medium that is instantaneous, reaches out to millions at once and is the way of the future of music.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com</strong></p><p><strong>Farmaanaa</strong> - is one of my favorites! Its sexy, filled with easy-loving, the rain, a great dance groove and it is song that has beautiful lyrics. It&rsquo;s the kind of song that can help you make-up after a bad fight, make love or just shut out the world and make you happy! </p><p><br /><strong>Todona</strong> - is the kind of song you can carry on your i-pod and enjoy anywhere! At a dinner, in a lounge, on a long drive I would loop it non-stop. For me music is about spreading the love and forgetting the past and forgiving and moving on. This is the perfect plea for love. </p><p><br /><strong>Kho gaye</strong> - is, vocally, one of most exciting offerings. It showcases different aspects to me a as singer and I really enjoyed recording this song, setting harmonies, the different arrangements. The fact that we chose NOT to lyrically interpret the chorus was also fun. It different, its soothing and its meant to transport you to a place you love - I hope it does!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you were not a singer, what would you have been?</strong></p><p><br />A pilot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor</strong></p><p><br />Every artiste I have heard. I have learnt a bit from everyone - though Whitney Houston, Abba, Celine dion and Barbara.<br />Streisand cds were my original teachers!!!</p><p><strong>You Like <br /></strong></p><p>Simplicity in thought. Money. Music. Laughter. Good movies. Shopping. Travelling. Luxury. Food.</p><p><strong>You Dislike</strong></p><p>Complexity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your Favorite <br /></strong></p><p><strong>Singer&nbsp; </strong>Whitney Houston, Amy Lee (lead singer Evanesence), Sonu Nigam, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Palash Sen, Fergie, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefanie, Justin Timberlake </p><p><br /><strong>Musician</strong>&nbsp; Justin Timberlake, Slash, Meredith Brooks, J Lo, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Coldplay, James Blunt, Salim-Suleiman, Shankar-ehsaan-Loy, A.R. Rehman, R.D. Burman <br />Song Endless Summer Nights and Mora Saiyyan Moonh Se Bole Na</p><p><strong>Your trademark</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong>Diversity </p><p><strong>Your message to your fans<br /></strong></p><p>Spread the music! Stand up against piracy! Support the music! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com</strong></p><p>There is no place for the musician to really get out there and&nbsp; be heard and everything is net dependent today and everything is digitally bought on your mobile phone, laptops, ipods, everything is digital . and we&nbsp; have a platform here that can combine what an artist wants to get out there, sell the right way, or sell the way that the audience wants to buy it.. that&rsquo;s way platform like this ArtistAloud.com. Three cheers!<br />&nbsp;<br />Its a bold, new, innovative way at how independent artistes can be heard and I am proud to be on it. At a time when radio stations, television channels, the media and music companies in India have abandoned non-film artistes, Hungama has shown tremendous faith and gumption in supporting us and in allowing us to be heard and its about time we are - loud and clear! ArtistAloud is here! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></Press_News_Content>

Because I love it when people appreciate my work and say (chin) -2 much!!! Because it&rsquo;s alpha numeric which reminds me of those equation kind of math which I&rsquo;m terrible at and almost flunked! Because it reminds me of what I&rsquo;ll get if I put on weight and stop exercising (which I hate doing!!)! Because a rose by any other name will still smell the same! Because it reflects a little bit of creativity which reflects me! Because I like it!!! &ndash; You choose!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You have been with Band of Boys for a long time and you recently released your first debut album which featured your Grandma, the great, Ashaji. How did it feel going solo? Do you prefer going solo or as a band?</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">To set the record straight, the times we&rsquo;ve had as a Band (and will continue to do so of course!) have been some of the wildest, freakiest, stupidest and best times I&rsquo;ve ever had . . . Only a fool would want to end that and somehow I don&rsquo;t see myself as one!! So, just for the record, though I&rsquo;ve gone solo, &lsquo;A Band of Boys&rsquo; will always exist (hopefully we&rsquo;ll be singing toothless and with a cane in hand on stage when we&rsquo;re 80!). </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">The first thing that struck me (in a nice way!) about gong solo is that you have complete control over your music, identity and shows. There no longer exists a &lsquo;collective&rsquo; decision for everything. If you want to edit something to your style, you can or if you want to compose something that purely appeals to you, you can - without having a one-fourth say in the matter!! And that in itself helps you explore your identity and find your own footing. It&rsquo;s a wonderful feeling to walk down this path of self discovery.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">But if you ask me to choose between the two . . . Tough question! I can&rsquo;t!! As I said earlier, the band is an inherent part of me. I love doing the things we do together<span>&nbsp; </span>travel, shows, parties, etc. which I would never be the same as a solo artiste! Yet, I love the new found sense of my individuality!! Situation is somewhat like this - what to do . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>Kaju khaoon ya pista!!!!!?!?!?! Love them both!!!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">A resounding YES to the second question! But if you were to ask me how does one tap into it?!?! Well that&rsquo;s a different ball game all together.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Our music industry per se is a very unique one, to be found no where else in this solar system! Why?! Well our music has always been driven by films which roughly translates to<span>&nbsp; </span>great aspiration and star value, humongous budgets and difficult-to-fight clout!!! </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">It&rsquo;s not that film music is better than the non-film music oh no!!! There&rsquo;s some great stuff out there being made all the time . . . It&rsquo;s just that people don&rsquo;t get to hear it. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">If you hear a crappy song 500 times a day, on radio, TV and the internet - all the time &ndash; you (being a homosapien) are bound to, at some point, start liking it. Whether you want to or not! Believe me, you don&rsquo;t have a choice &ndash; I too am a victim of this phenomenon! </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">And that&rsquo;s what film music does today &ndash; it bombards you mindlessly. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong though - there&rsquo;s some great music being churned out in the industry and I, for one, am a huge fan of composers like A. R. Rahman, Vishal-Shekhar, Pritam, Shankar/ Ehsaan/ Loy -<span>&nbsp; </span>to name a few. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">More to the point, the non-film market in India, to my mind, has a market and can never die. And here&rsquo;s why - </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Unlike film music, non-film music doesn&rsquo;t work to a brief. There is no &lsquo;situation&rsquo; or hero telling a heroine something or dictat from a director/ producer who wants a peppy hit or a slow ballad hit or a finger clicking hit (they always want a hit in whatever it is you make!!!). Non film music (and this is exactly how I make my music) is an inspiration that you want to express. Just as a poet writes a poem, a writer writes a book or an artist paints a painting . . . . Your art reflects your inspiration. You express what has moved you or touched you. And you hope that somebody identifies with your expression and is touched the way you are. And if one person agrees with your expression, he sets your soul aglow!! If that persons agreement is multiplied by over a million people, you have a resounding hit and make shitloads of money and life looks good! But, (and this is the most important part!) before the money comes the satisfaction of your private, personal expression being appreciated. And that&rsquo;s what we live for. That&rsquo;s our oxygen. If a piece of work is put out there, as a labour of love and in all genuineness, someone somewhere will appreciate it. That&rsquo;s my guarantee!! So yes, the market has existed and will always exist!!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Hosh Udaye:</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Sometime in 2006, the mukhda of this song was written when I was at a radio workshop in Ahmedabad! I was then the Programming Head of Mumbai of what is today India&rsquo;s largest networked radio station, Big FM, and going though a lot of tension, angst, sleepless nights and chaos! I was sitting with a couple of radio jocks from Kolkatta, Mumbai and Guwahati, chatting, plucking on their guitar and this may sound spooky but out of the blue I started humming this tune and strumming the guitar! I quickly recorded it (as I tend to forget tunes extremely fast!!) and that was the genesis of this song. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">To put my thoughts to words, full credit to my mother-in-law, Rekha Bhimani (unfortunately that word is associated with such negative connotations thanks to the soaps we have on TV today &ndash; saans! But let me tell you that word means only awesome&rsquo;ness to me!! Just can&rsquo;t understand what the hoopla is all about man!)</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Anyway, so this song is all about the girl who never was beautiful enough to win a beauty pageant BUT whose aura and energy is so exquisite and pure that she can silence a room with her presence, whose laughter is so in synergy with nature that it&rsquo;s musical . . . She&rsquo;s the elusive teaser and through personal experience, not the girl I&rsquo;d want to marry but the one for whose attention I would vie for . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>And as you may have guessed, I knew of just such a girl in my days as a college student! This song I dedicate to her. And if she reads these words, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll know that I speak of her! And I hope, with all my heart, that she&rsquo;s happy wherever she is, with her family and children and laughing that golden laugh of hers . . . .</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Happy Bdae Asha Aai</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">This I shall always be proud of!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How it happened - I was busy recording at home one evening and as was her habit (when she was just about to turn 2), my daughter would normally plonk herself on my lap and start singing whatever came to mind or her heart desired!!! </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">This fortunate day, I had the microphone plugged in and prior to her singing this, Aditi (my wife) and me were discussing Asha Bhosle&rsquo;s (my grand-moms) impending birthday. Little Mishka promptly came running into my studio, saw me recording some scratch stuff for my album, sat on my lap and disregarding anything that I might have been doing, held the mike and started belting it out!!!! I (with a little bit of irritation I must admit) stopped my maha-creative process to accommodate the 4th generation Bhosle genius and promptly pressed the record button. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What you hear is unprocessed, unedited and sheer inspiration (from whence I have no clue!!). </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">The guitar underlay I added much later just out of curiosity to see how well she held her sur. And I can, as an extremely proud father, say she&rsquo;s done a commendable job! I&rsquo;ll be playing this to all your boy friends Mishka Bhosle, so beware!!! ïŠ</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Grow Old with me:-</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Grow old with me&#39; is essentially every clich&eacute; you might ever have heard of in a song! Chin2 says &ldquo;this song is a part of my life - this song is about my wife Aditi and me<span>&nbsp; </span>and has been written from the heart based on stuff we&#39;ve done together! So if you&#39;re the kind of person who can look beyond the obvious and who can perhaps sense a slice of life in a song, I think you should definitely enjoy this one!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">If you were not a singer, what would you have been?</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">If not a singer, ummm, I was well on my way to becoming a marketing/ advertising professional . . . a radio jockey . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>a theatre actor . . . a video jockey . . . a . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>wow man, there&rsquo;re sooo many things that interest me!! But somewhere deep down, aside from music I&rsquo;ve always had a great love for flying!

Like an Eric Clapton or Bob Dylan . . . Great guys, awesome work but I&rsquo;m generally inspired by people who I interact with. For eg. Gino Banks (percussionist), Sheldon D&rsquo;Silva (bassist), Sangeet Haldipur (keyboardist) . . . Young guys, fully dedicated to their art and can give any senior professional musician a run for their money at the age of 25! When Gino is tired after a long day of travel he unwinds by playing his drums for 2 hours!!!

<Press_News_Featured><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Hosh Udaye:</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Sometime in 2006, the mukhda of this song was written when I was at a radio workshop in Ahmedabad! I was then the Programming Head of Mumbai of what is today India&rsquo;s largest networked radio station, Big FM, and going though a lot of tension, angst, sleepless nights and chaos! I was sitting with a couple of radio jocks from Kolkatta, Mumbai and Guwahati, chatting, plucking on their guitar and this may sound spooky but out of the blue I started humming this tune and strumming the guitar! I quickly recorded it (as I tend to forget tunes extremely fast!!) and that was the genesis of this song. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">To put my thoughts to words, full credit to my mother-in-law, Rekha Bhimani (unfortunately that word is associated with such negative connotations thanks to the soaps we have on TV today &ndash; saans! But let me tell you that word means only awesome&rsquo;ness to me!! Just can&rsquo;t understand what the hoopla is all about man!)</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Anyway, so this song is all about the girl who never was beautiful enough to win a beauty pageant BUT whose aura and energy is so exquisite and pure that she can silence a room with her presence, whose laughter is so in synergy with nature that it&rsquo;s musical . . . She&rsquo;s the elusive teaser and through personal experience, not the girl I&rsquo;d want to marry but the one for whose attention I would vie for . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>And as you may have guessed, I knew of just such a girl in my days as a college student! This song I dedicate to her. And if she reads these words, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll know that I speak of her! And I hope, with all my heart, that she&rsquo;s happy wherever she is, with her family and children and laughing that golden laugh of hers . . . .</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Happy Bdae Asha Aai</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">This I shall always be proud of!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How it happened - I was busy recording at home one evening and as was her habit (when she was just about to turn 2), my daughter would normally plonk herself on my lap and start singing whatever came to mind or her heart desired!!! </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">This fortunate day, I had the microphone plugged in and prior to her singing this, Aditi (my wife) and me were discussing Asha Bhosle&rsquo;s (my grand-moms) impending birthday. Little Mishka promptly came running into my studio, saw me recording some scratch stuff for my album, sat on my lap and disregarding anything that I might have been doing, held the mike and started belting it out!!!! I (with a little bit of irritation I must admit) stopped my maha-creative process to accommodate the 4th generation Bhosle genius and promptly pressed the record button. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What you hear is unprocessed, unedited and sheer inspiration (from whence I have no clue!!). </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">The guitar underlay I added much later just out of curiosity to see how well she held her sur. And I can, as an extremely proud father, say she&rsquo;s done a commendable job! I&rsquo;ll be playing this to all your boy friends Mishka Bhosle, so beware!!! ïŠ</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Grow Old with me:-</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Grow old with me&#39; is essentially every clich&eacute; you might ever have heard of in a song! Chin2 says &ldquo;this song is a part of my life - this song is about my wife Aditi and me<span>&nbsp; </span>and has been written from the heart based on stuff we&#39;ve done together! So if you&#39;re the kind of person who can look beyond the obvious and who can perhaps sense a slice of life in a song, I think you should definitely enjoy this one!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">If you were not a singer, what would you have been?</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">If not a singer, ummm, I was well on my way to becoming a marketing/ advertising professional . . . a radio jockey . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>a theatre actor . . . a video jockey . . . a . . .<span>&nbsp; </span>wow man, there&rsquo;re sooo many things that interest me!! But somewhere deep down, aside from music I&rsquo;ve always had a great love for flying! It&rsquo;s just that I hated maths and thus never pursued it professionally but if you were to come home you&rsquo;d see the three hard earned flight training certificates I have acquired through hours of training and many sleepless nights . . . . on my computer . . . thanks to Microsoft&rsquo;s Flight Simlator!</span></p></Press_News_Featured>

<Press_News_Content><h2>ArtistAloud.com launched to promote unreleased music by independent artists</h2>		<div class="date">08 January, 2010</div> 			 		<a href="http://hungama.org/" target="&rsquo;_blank&rsquo;">Hungama Digital Media</a> has launched <a href="http://artistaloud.com/" target="&rsquo;_blank&rsquo;">ArtistAloud.com</a>, a digital distribution platform for unreleased music created by independent artists. According to Hungama, all artistes on board retain the publishing rights of their compositions and can take their music onto the physical medium via any record label. <br /><br />ArtistAloud.com offers DRM (digital rights management)-free music at Rs 10 a piece. One can also download four songs at Rs 20. The songs are made available in mp3 format, for both PC and mobile devices. The website currently features songs spanning over six genres which range from alternative pop, classic Indi-pop, fusion, English rock, Hindi rock and Bollywood pop. <br /><br />The ArtistAloud music library can also be accessed through Hungama&rsquo;s domestic and international digital distribution partnerships comprising, mobile operators, Hungama.com, the BSNL storefront, iTunes, Rhapsody, Amazon MP3, and through the Tata Sky DTH platform. <br /><br />Neeraj Roy, MD and CEO, Hungama Digital Media, has said, &ldquo;Hungama&rsquo;s new initiative, ArtistAloud.com, combines the possibilities of digital platform with great musical talent. It rests on two pillars -- giving each artist his freedom of expression and music lovers their right to choose from a wider offering.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Today, nobody supports or promotes the independent artiste and as a consequence good talent suffers. I am extremely happy that ArtistAloud.com is supporting and giving them a platform for promotion and I give them my aashirvaad wholeheartedly,&rdquo; Asha Bhosle, a Bollywood playback singer, has said. <br /><br />Shaan, another Bollywood playback singer, has added, &ldquo;I appreciate the (ArtistAloud.com) effort as it aims to help independent musicians and music businesses thrive in the changing media environment. Importantly, the musician can directly connect with its audience without the mercy of any music company.&rdquo;</Press_News_Content>

By mixing lounge with Indian elements like flute, duff but yet kept the indian melody as the base of the song. The entire song revolves around the lyrics, the melody and the style of singing.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Nazrein Yun Jo Tumse Mili</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">- The song has minimal arrangement and a lot of acoustic instruments.

A corporate jingle composed for &ldquo;you telecom&rdquo; was Dhwani&rsquo;s first commercial break. It is a relatively a young band, who hopes to grow with each passing year, in experience, in their music.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How did you guys come together as a band? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Mayuresh and Bipin used to jam together. Bouncing off ideas about a band, Bipin and Mayuresh decided to give it a try.<span>&nbsp; </span>Aalok, basically had been interested in different genres from the start. Meeting Mayuresh for a classical recording, Aalok immediately showed an interest in the whole concept of Dhwani. Tushar being a common friend and also a very talented tabla player joined on board. The big search however was for a good drummer. After a couple of auditions, the drummer thing was at a standstill. Ganesh came in through another common friend of ours and after our first jam, this guy was here to stay. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Also one of the most important reasons binding Dhwani is their interest in experimenting in diverse and equally creative genres.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What does Dhwani mean to the group?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Dhwani is an idea that has been nurtured and every member wishes to see it become a success.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your lead singer is an Indian Classical Singer.

Aalok comes from a very classical background. As aalok says, he always tries to complement the riffs and melodies with ragas complimenting those notes. That&rsquo;s how the whole melody shapes up.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Who do you see connecting to your music? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">We do not frame music in any particular genre.

That&rsquo;s when he realized that this was his destiny. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">However fulfilling his destiny has been the hardest part. As put in his own words, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine my life without music now. Everything I do, I do it in terms of music. But there was a time when I used to face the conflict of having chosen music over a conventional profession every day.

Got together with some friends who wanted to form a pop band and that&rsquo;s how I started gigging playing at functions. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">As Suraj and I were pretty much in the same field of music we had seen each other perform at concerts. There came an opportunity where Suraj had to put together a make shift band to perform for a corporate party and that&rsquo;s when he called me up and asked me if I was interested in playing for it. The gig didn&rsquo;t happen but we realized that we had similar interest, that of writing original music. So we jammed together and put out an Album called Human Race.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How did the name Dream Out Loud come about? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">DOL : Much before we got this band together we had painted a picture of us playing gigs, and people singing our songs at gigs, and we wanted to do that not by covering other artists, but with our own original compositions! So lets just say at that point we were Dreaming Out Loud! Hence the name.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You perform very regularly in Hard Rock Caf&eacute; and other venues. Describe your experiences performing live?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">DOL : We play live all over India pretty often and the feeling is absolutely unexplainable. There&rsquo;s nothing in this world that can make you feel , like the way one feels, when the audience connects with you in person. It&rsquo;s exhilarating!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">The lead singer of your group, Suraj does a lot of work for Bollywood. How does he manage to switch off and switch on musically between the two styles?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Suraj Jagan : I don&rsquo;t need to switch on and off. I love singing. So styles don&rsquo;t matter at all. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your music is very melodic but also manages to cater to head bangers. What do you think of while writing your songs? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">DOL : One does not think when composing a song. When composing a song one writes about what one is feeling in The Moment. It&rsquo;s all about feeling &amp; less of thinking. So, I guess the kind of music both of us have grown up listening to, makes us write and compose in a certain way. The kind of music we write, comes very naturally to us. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">DOL : The music world has seen a major change. Rather the way music is sold and heard globally has been revolutionized. We know for a fact that digital distribution is the only way to keep in contact with your fans and reach out to them in any corner of the world. Apart from that it gives the listener the power to choose the tracks they want to hear &amp; download! </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Where do you think the music industry is going?

We have so many fans that come to watch us perform and ask us where they can get our songs.

Call it luck, but a photographer there took a picture of Shashank and put it in a News paper as a part of a promotional article for Sunday Jams. Beginner&rsquo;s luck?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">How did you guys come together as a band?</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Aveer and Shashank did their engineering from the same college (REC/NITK Surathkal) and used to play in the college band. Once out of college, and after 2 years of Job, they decided that it was time to pursue their passion as life was becoming really boring. So 3 guys from the college band started Jamming together, eventually 2 remained, got a bassist, a drummer and formed a band. Bharath, joined subsequently, when the band realized that the Key to the sound they wanted, was indeed hidden in Bharath&rsquo;s Keyboards. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Somewhere is some other part of the world, 2 guys from BITS Pilani,<span>&nbsp; </span>who also used to play together in the college band were leading their lives completely unaware of where their fates would lead them. One of them Mahesh ,decided one fine day that he is going to start playing drums again ( we guess, mainly motivated by his wifes hysterical laughs when he told her he was a star drummer in college). He searched the internet and stumbled upon this band which was looking for a drummer and liked their music. He joined Ek. He brought in the other guy, Victor, the bassist into the band.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Thus Ek was formed.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What is the meaning behind naming the group Ek?</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">The Band was christened &lsquo;Ek&rsquo; by accident if not anything else, mainly due to urgency to get the band registered for their first gig, the Sunday Jam .<span>&nbsp; </span>Shashank thought of the simplest name that came to his mind and got the band registered , thinking, we will change it later.<span>&nbsp; </span>But in retrospect, the name fitted perfectly as it represents the very elements of which the Bands music is made of. Simplicity, yet subtle complexities and different level of interpretations. So that explains why it was never changed. But yes, we did discuss, that if we didn&rsquo;t perform well at that gig,<span>&nbsp; </span>we will release the version 2, and call it &lsquo;Do&rsquo; ( Hindi )<span>&nbsp; </span>and so on.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank god we are still &lsquo;Ek&rsquo;.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You had made your music available for free downloads previously. What made you want to release them commercially through ArtistAloud.com?</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">We as a band have always felt very possessive about our music, and we are sure a lot of artists feel the same. Till now the only way of making the songs spread to the masses was through the record labels, which in turn resulted in tampering of the songs to make them more Commercially viable. This is something no true artist would like. We as artists have always needed the freedom to create music that is not influenced by factors like: Will this be liked by people? Will this be liked by the record label, will this fit in the script? Is this too complicated? Etc etc&hellip;. we need the freedom to express ourselves through our music , when this happens, these songs become more than a commodity.<span>&nbsp; </span>But we always wondered, How do we spread this music to people? As we didn&rsquo;t have an answer, we put our songs for free download. It took some time, but the right answer did come:<span>&nbsp; </span>ArtistAloud.com.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">It was worth the wait.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Why have you taken the digital approach? </span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">We should be thanking the big demon who came about as a result of the digital and internet revolution. Come-on you know what we are talking about : Piracy. Taking the digital approach is the only way to really befriend this demon and actually use his powers to our advantage. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Kya Yeh Sach Hai</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">:</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">We look for a miracle all our lifes .

The whole industry was present, especially those who gave work, I did a good job, Bombay Times supported me via a beautiful article written by Martin D&rsquo;costa and it was smooth sailing from here on! </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You are one of the most versatile entertainers in the industry who has built her name through live shows much before releasing an album. How have you achieved that?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Through my faith in God and in realizing that He is the best manager one can ever hope for! My career has really been a series of miracles and I learnt early on to just do my best and leave the rest to God!!</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You are now getting into acting. Do you feel this will work better for you as a singer or is it just another feather in the cap?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Everything I do in the entertainment industry is with a view to promote my music and me as a singer. I have acted before, theatre, serials, but music is my first love and I do believe to be a complete entertainer you must be able to present yourself and your music interestingly and here acting, comparing, modeling, all help tremendously.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You have composed, written and sung the songs that you are releasing through this platform. Do you feel it is easier to sing one&rsquo;s own compositions or when someone else composes for you?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">I believe you know your own compositions better than anyone else and end up giving them more time, more of yourself and more effort, hence they may turn out better overall. The only place it really works for me to have composed the song I have sung is when I am shooting a video because here, knowing the song better than anyone else can really help you emote it the way it needs to be shown.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Why have you taken the digital approach? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Everything has become digital! No one buys cds the traditional way in a store - except die-hards like me who still like to OWN the hard copy, own a bit of the artiste this way. It&rsquo;s an exciting medium that is instantaneous, reaches out to millions at once and is the way of the future of music.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Farmaanaa</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> - is one of my favorites!

Composed by Vanraj Bhatia. Written by Mehboob, Suman Sarin and me. Created video of the song titled HUSN.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">After your debut pop album, you went into making quite a few children&rsquo;s albums. How did that come about?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">As an artist I always felt that one area that has been neglected severely in our country<span>&nbsp; </span>is creativity and development of children vis a vis music.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you take a closer look at the albums I have created for children you will find that I have tried to create relevance for Indian children who are usually force fed with Twinkle Twinkle or Humpty Dumpty since ages.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course Indian children are entitled to a grooming in western culture and school of education, but don&rsquo;t you think they deserve a lot more than conventional nursery rhymes? </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">So my journey in edutainment started with my first album of original nursery rhymes titled HAPPY DAY released in 2002 and then I kept creating songs for children in various regional languages apart from Hindi and English. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You run an NGO as well. How do you find the time to run that and which would take precedence if you were to choose between your music or running the NGO?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">I am a trained Special Educator having done my Bed in Deaf Education from the Ali Yavar Jung National Institute for the Hearing Handicapped , Mumbai in 1990, and have worked in various capacities with leading institutes in the country. Trinayani was created in 2006 as a sensitization, awareness generating and advocacy group to highlight the strengths of people with disabilities.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Music is not different from breathing for me. And you do not think before you breathe. On the other hand Trinayani is a welfare trust I devote a lot of time to as I use the medium of entertainment to reach out to people and the arts play an important role in this advocacy process.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your music and talent is multi genre and multilingual.

Also does it help to have a style or be able to sing any style as long its good music?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">I enjoy music from any region, of any language and any style and versatility allows me to sing in different genres. I think it is my strength. However the question is if the industry thinks it to be an asset or not? In my opinion, people would rather you be a Bhajan singer or a Ghazal singer or one who sings soft number, it is very confusing when they are faced with a singer who is at ease with different styles. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You have some Bollywood songs to your credit. Does it feel more fulfilling singing for Bollywood or your own music?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Both are equally fulfilling and challenging. Once you have sung a bollywood song it also becomes your own. Creating your own music is like giving birth , you have to go through labour.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Why have you taken the Digital approach? </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Because the world is taking that route.

We were writing our own songs even then, and got our first big break when Doordarshan ( no satellite TV then ) shot a video on our track. It featured me playing Drums and Singing. That video was played for 7-8-years on DD and everyone knew who we were. Even till date people remember me from that video. It was a great track too. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You had quite a few successful albums almost a decade ago but you seemed to have disappeared from the scene.

Then came the Indi-pop revolution and I&#39;ve been told by many that my project Tu Hi Tu was in a way one of the spearheads of that movement. The album did really well and helped to establish me as a serious player. Thereafter I released another pop project which also had a pretty decent run but by then the remix bandwagon had totally taken over.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">I consider that period as the darkest in the history of Non-Film music in our country as complete non-entities were being made into stars by impotent and incompetent record company executives who had no absolutely no vision or sense of music and thought the remix scam would go on forever. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">I was so upset that I made a song and shot a video called &quot;Mujhse banta nahin Remix Kya Karun I&#39;m in a fix&quot; openly criticizing the remix culture as it had denied a generation of artists their due. That album was my 4th solo effort and made it to the top 5 albums of the year.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">So I&#39;ve been around inspite of dealing with all this junk and hanging in there awaiting a revival vehicle like Artist Aloud.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You are more known as a drummer.

They&#39;re only a few and they&#39;re all busy doing their own thing. However I&#39;m currently in the composing stage for an instrumental project which will feature me predominantly as a drum artist and hopefully it will be ready by next year.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Yet I have been quite busy on the live performance front as I keep doing Digital percussion gigs all over and have been getting some amazing responses. In fact I&#39;ve been entered into the Limca book of records for my high speed Double Bass Drumming, it&#39;s quite an achievement and I&#39;m rather proud of it.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">What do you prefer more, singing or playing the drums?

I think it&#39;s a matter of natural acumen and then personal practice that will determine your proficiency. Fortunately for me God has gifted me with varied abilities of composing, writing, singing and playing. I&rsquo;m even recording and mixing my own tracks now, so I&rsquo;m constantly at it, learning more and more as I go along.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com?</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">AJEEB:</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">This is a very special song that I penned in a highly contemplative state, and it&rsquo;s all true.

I must say that I am grat</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">eful to my fans for having been so patient and appreciating my music despite long gaps between albums.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt"><span>&nbsp;</span>I think the main reason for this is the popularity of my live shows which kept me connected with my audience. Of course the fact that Paree became a classic helped a lot!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">In your hay days you were appreciated for your performances on stage.

Do you feel you had to do that as a cause or was it a natural progression to your career? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">I think it was a natural progression of my evolvement as a human being and as an artist. I had the chance to write all the songs myself without any interference from record companies or contributions by other composers , so what it resulted in was an expression of who I was at the time. It wasn&rsquo;t easy , and it was enhanced by the musicians who later on produced it. And it definitely represents a transition in my career in terms of the type of music I will be performing in the future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">Why have you taken the digital approach? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">It has been a long journey in the traditional format and having had the satisfaction of creating actual CD&rsquo;s I felt it was time to reach out to a larger audience , since the way people are listening to music is changing and I wanted to be a part of that.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">WAQT</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt"> is about how powerful Time is and how it influences our life.

How did that come about? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Ha ha ha it is all about the music and not about the language. I have always had a talent of grasping languages fast and that came pretty handy in Chennai. Since I was in Chennai and Tamil is very big, rather the biggest here so I started singing in Tamil. I have also sung in other languages like Telegu, Malayalam, Kannada and of-course my mother-tongue Bengali apart from Hindi, Urdu, Assamese and English.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You have done a lot of work with A.R Rahman. How has that been? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">That probably has been one of the best and most enlightening experiences of my life. It is not only an honor to work with him but as a musician and composer one gets to learn a lot from the way he works. He makes you think like a creator and just not a mere vocalist. I got to re-invent myself in a completely new perspective. One constantly has to upgrade one&rsquo;s talent. For example, in one of the Tamil songs I had sung for him, I had to modulate my voice in 4 different styles. That&rsquo;s what he prompts you to do &ndash; to re-invent yourself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Why have you taken the Digital approach? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Why not? You know when compact discs were introduced first in the market after magnetic tapes, people started wondering how it would be with the new technology. But it made life so much easier and less cumbersome. Also the quality of sound became much better. Today with the internet being accessible anywhere and everywhere and cities becoming wi-fi enabled, I think it&rsquo;s the easiest way to access any kind of music from all over the world. Makes life easier again! It is also another way of reducing music piracy.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Mora Saiya</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> &ndash; a melodic mix of Hindustani elements with drum and bass.

I am a melody person and it is very obvious in this number where the song moves through different scales and notes yet merges at one point &ndash; the soul of the song which lingers in your ears long after it is over.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Heer</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> &ndash; Punjabi folk songs have always inspired me especially the ones which talk about pain and separation.

I have, as long as I remember, handled two professions simultaneously. It&rsquo;s only now that I have plunged into music completely.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your Inspiration or Mentor?</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">My mother</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You Like?</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">A Kind Gesture</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">You Dislike?</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Pessimism</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your Favorite?</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Singer -</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> Asha Bhosle, Ghulam Ali, Jagjit Singh, Bjork, Geoff Tate (Queensryche) and Tarja Turunen (Nightwish).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Musician </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&ndash; R D Burman, A R Rahman, Peter Gabriel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Song </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">&ndash; There are too many of them and if I mentioned one I&rsquo;d do injustice to the others. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your trademark?</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">My vocal versatility which helps me in treating and rendering each song differently from the other.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Your message to your fans</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Enjoy the music. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">ArtistAloud.com&nbsp; </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">It is fantastic that Artist Aloud has opened the door to new and original compositions by a fresh bunch of artists.

CDs were big when I started my career as a singer. Now people want to download music to their PCs and phones,&rdquo; says singing sensation Suneeta Rao, who has gone digital with artistaloud.com.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Pioneered by Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, artistaloud.com aims at providing an opportunity for independent artistes to connect with their fans. It also attempts to combat piracy by making music directly available to fans, and appears to be a much-awaited solution for musicians who haven&#39;t been able to get a commercial release for their original compositions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <strong><p>Immediate feedback</p></strong> <p>Ask her why it&#39;s important for an established singer such as her to go digital, and Suneeta explains: &ldquo;When there is a medium that allows one to receive immediate feedback from fans, any artiste would want to use that.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The alternative pop singer&#39;s last release was &lsquo;Waqt&#39; in mid-2008, which received an overwhelming response, and she thinks it is the popularity of the live shows she does between new releases that actually endears people to her. In an age when newer forms and genres of music take shape, Suneeta has managed to remain popular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But she feels: &ldquo;The word diva has been used to describe far too many qualities and attributes.

What does stand out about our country is the surge of talent.&rdquo; However, Suneeta asserts: &ldquo;There are drawbacks that come with such shows. What happens most often is that people trying to make it big in the music industry live up to a clich&eacute;d role model. This defeats the very purpose of trying to find someone new, someone different. There is no originality in many of these shows.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On future plans, Suneeta says: &ldquo;My three-month-old baby is my priority, so there isn&#39;t too much apart from artistaloud.com that I&#39;m thinking about.&rdquo; When Suneeta isn&#39;t crooning, she dances, performs as a theatre artiste, takes Spanish lessons, travels extensively, and even scuba dives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>                                                              NEETI SARKAR</Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday? </strong><br />Dec 17th<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene?</strong><br />I had my first gig as a solo drummer at the age of 5 and many more after that but as a recording artist, my first break came shortly after I was discovered by a music producer during a college band performance. I sang for a compilation album; one of the songs I sang was in Spanish, there after I was considered &ldquo;into the scene&rsquo;&rsquo;.<br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />It&rsquo;s pretty much the melody and rhythm. A good melody almost always connects with the listener over a longer period of time. Being a dancer, I have a penchant for digging rhythm and experimenting with sounds. In my music I like to put a &lsquo;Bling Moment&rsquo;; this could be anything from beat-boxing (which I do), a catchy interlude or the &lsquo;stop n go&rsquo; of rhythm - a structure that suddenly turns the song around and back again. Also, I believe my singing style has its own individuality.<br /><br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed? </strong><br />Like what we are doing here, selling music online is the quickest way to reach out to people across the globe. This combined with clever marketing and promotion! However, true fans are most likely to buy a CD off the shelf. As a performer, touring and performing live is one of the best ways I can connect to people, let them relate to the artist they are listening to, let them consume your personality along with the music, let them be mesmerized. I&rsquo;d want my audience, when they go back after the show to say, &ldquo;I gotta watch that again!&rdquo; Give them an experience.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />When I&rsquo;m making my music, I honestly don&rsquo;t decide a particular section of listeners to aim it at. I just do it! I&rsquo;m a storyteller, I tell a story and then that story finds its way through a melody, a rhythm, instruments and my voice ; who so ever can relate to those stories, will be able to relate to my music. Geography no bar!<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />Let&rsquo;s face it- the traditional music business is crumbling and it&#39;s now the Do-It-Yourself Era. At no time in history have independent artists had so many opportunities to create high-quality music and sell it to the masses. And what&#39;s the main thing that&#39;s driving this incredible change? The Internet -- where millions upon millions of people go every day to search for new music. Why only the World Wide Web? Throw in the mobile and DTH technology too! The buzz word is- Connect! People can instantly get the music (read: Legally) in the comfort of their bean bag or palm. I&rsquo;m looking at the future and beyond; the endless possibilities gives me such a rush!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />The entry of new age composers who are from nontraditional &lsquo;filmy&rsquo; background has brought about the change in the sound and blurring the divide between non filmy and filmy music. What an independent artist needs is a sellable product and a genius marketing.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t mince my words; it&rsquo;s all about being able to sell!<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />T.D.M.(Tere Dil Mein) is my first single on ArtistAloud.com. I penned and composed this song a few years back and recorded a demo. The song tells a real life story of that time. As usual, I tend to spend a lot of time on each record I produce; putting each sound under the microscope and giving it a character. The same happened with TDM and then a rude shock of deadlines sank in! It was crazy towards the end; living literally in the studio. Finally, after a long wait its out for the world and my sincere thanks to ArtistAloud.com for initiating it.<br /><br /><strong>If not a singer what else you would have been? </strong><br />I already have a second stable career as an Entrepreneur, Animation Film Maker and a Visual Artist. Seriously, I hate the sound of &ldquo;If not a musician, then?&rdquo; <br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites</strong><br /><br />Singers- Many! To name a few; Kishore Kumar, Frank Sinatra, Sting, Bono,Usher, Michael Jackson, James Brown, Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen, Rhydian, Annie Lennox..Ok too many!!! <br />Songs- Dude, you could have asked me about quantum physics rather.<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness? </strong><br />Music vs. Music<br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br />I do take inspiration from some of the greatest in the music, film and entertainment business for their respective expertise ranging from stage presence, presentation, entertainment value to vocal dexterity and dancing skills.<br />Along with these, I&rsquo;m always inspired by my parents (who are also musicians) for the amount of tireless energy, hard work and dedication they have put in over the years.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Your most prized possession? </strong><br />My voice for you to listen and my body for it to move.<br /><strong><br />Your Favorite Quote?</strong><br />What we think, or what we know, or what we believe is, in the end, of little consequence. The only consequence is what we do.<br /><br /><strong>Your Trademark?</strong><br />Hahaha..ummm well, my hats, belts, my moves and showmanship I guess.<br /><br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart?</strong><br />Yes, I&rsquo;m associated with a few NGOs and other organizations for causes like Education, health and social welfare. I don&rsquo;t really like to talk about them though.<br /><br /><strong>Singing to you is?</strong> <br />Like making love. It makes my heart, mind, body and soul work in culmination; where I relish giving the joy as much as deriving from.<br /><br /><strong>Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)? </strong><br />Be prepared as an artist. Believe in what you can deliver and at the same time, be your own honest critic. Don&rsquo;t try too hard to be different from the rest, just be aware of it at a subconscious level.<br /><br /><strong>Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com.</strong><br />AristAloud.com is a dream come true for all independent singers and musicians. We really needed something like this and they came just in time! My heartfelt best wishes to the entire team.</Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><br /><strong>Your Birthday? </strong><br />30th October 1971.<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene?</strong><br />Singing at a friend&rsquo;s party and got noticed. <br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />The tone, the ideas, the energy, expressions, love of the work I do.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed? </strong><br />As it comes. Just choose what s good for you as you would choose good oxygen over toxic. <br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />A little stream becomes a river as tributaries add up and flows to the ocean. Nothing happens alone. Music is by everyone, for everyone and of everyone.&nbsp; Have I answered your question?!!!!<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />I like going by the ways of the world. High &ldquo;tech&rdquo; is what I love to &ldquo;take&rdquo;. Ha ha ha. <br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />Music always goes in the right direction. Perceptions differ. Hurdles get diversified but music spells the same way always. Non film needs a different approach for sound and presentation to make it big in India through its film extravaganza. Effort in the sense of style, genre and magnitude of promotion must play together to make it heard loud. <br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />Tumi acho bole means &ldquo;because of you&rdquo;. Like Bengali beauty Bengali/Bangla musical emotion is jhakkas too. Just hear it once !<br /><br /><strong>If not a singer what else you would have been? </strong><br />A tape recorder !!! ultimately singing. Ha ha ha. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites</strong><br /><br /><strong>Singers</strong> &ndash; Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, Kishore Kumar, Shahnaz Rahmat Ullah, Abdul Aleem,&nbsp; Neena Hamid, Gloria Estefan, Natalie Cole, Frank Sinatra, Nazia Hasan, Diana Ross, Sade. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness? </strong><br />My strength is my voice and tonal quality and the ability to make it better everyday. Weakness is not be able to transcend my weakness like late nights and chocolates. <br /><strong><br />You Idolize, Why?</strong> <br />Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty and AR. For - Endurance, hard work, hard work, hard work and Modesty. <br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />My son. Why?

So cornea transplant is issue number 1. muslim girls get only a third of the parents&rsquo; property if they don&rsquo;t have a brother. That&rsquo;s silly in this context when women know how to fight men. That s issue 2.

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday? &nbsp;</strong><br />3rd July, 1978.<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene? </strong><br />Dec. 2000 (1st professional show, not amateur as was doing during college days before that).<br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong> <br />Versatility (soft pop to hard rock, Hindi &amp; English both), power and range of voice. Also, I write, compose n sing my own songs.<br /><br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed? </strong><br />Music should be neither heard, nor felt - IT SHOULD BE JUST BREATHED IN AND SUCKED INTO UR BLOOD!!!!<br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />Anyone who&rsquo;s ALIVE!<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music? </strong><br />This way it reaches the masses with least possible hindrances, no red-tapism here!<br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />I believe we deserve to make n hear better music than we&rsquo;re currently listening to. There certainly is an immense market for all kind of music, if only we explore it, makes it reach the people, the masses!!<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com?</strong> <br />SAVERA: My only song here yet, it&rsquo;s my salute to the undying human spirit. Conceptualized during a visit to one of the rehab centers after meeting the inhabitants there, it gradually grew into an ode to all who&rsquo;ve had the guts to fight the odds of life ever!! It motivates, it awakens, it arouses, it makes alive the dormant strength in you n me!!!<br /><strong><br />If not a singer what else you would have been? </strong><br />Ummm has to be a wannabe singer.<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites</strong><br />Singers: Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Amy Winehouse, Amy Lee, Steven Tyler, Axl Rose, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle, Kailash Kher&hellip;.many more<br />Musicians: R.D. Burman, S D Burman, Guns n Roses, Aerosmith, Eric Clapton and many others<br />Songs: Other than my own, it&rsquo;s a Long list again&hellip;.these days, <br />it&rsquo;s:Thank You for Loving Me,This I Love, Falling Slowly, Back To Black,Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho (old),Mujhe Mat Roko (mujhe yaar ke ghar jaane do), I really have many many more favourites!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness? </strong><br />I&rsquo;m a workaholic, a perfectionist and a bit too idealistic (sometimes foolishly idealistic!).&nbsp; I guess my same strengths sometimes serve as my weaknesses too! Also, I&rsquo;m extremely moody!<br /><br /><strong>You Idolize, Why?</strong><br />Honestly, I don&rsquo;t idolize PEOPLE&hellip;..i idolize their qualities&hellip;.no one is perfect!<br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?</strong><br />It started from my parents&hellip;.coz they fed me music ever since I was born; my teacher&hellip;.coz he made me taste some real good music n made me fall in love with it all over again; and my husband&hellip;..he made me realize how DEEP I had it in me n also that I need to make it reach the people!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Your most prized possession?</strong><br />My heart, my soul&hellip;.the day I stop feeling, I&rsquo;d cease to be!<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorite Quote?</strong><br />Think before you utter words that give someone pain; wounded hearts are slow at healing, IF they ever heal again!<br /><br /><strong>Your Trademark?</strong><br />My voice.<br /><br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart?</strong><br />I&rsquo;d pray to be given a chance to work for the support n understanding of the younger generation. With parents being too career oriented, children take a back seat, mostly after being borne. And then, unfortunately, they&rsquo;re traumatized more by being blamed for being selfish, reckless, without values etc. We forget&hellip;.they ARE what we&rsquo;ve MADE out of them. I&rsquo;d like to work in support of the kids, so they don&rsquo;t ruin a perfectly beautiful life they&rsquo;ve been given!<br /><br /><strong>Singing to you is? </strong><br />Religion, Love, Passion, Breath.<br /><br /><strong>Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)? </strong><br />Go where your heart takes you.

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday?</strong><br />Once a year in July &ndash; cards and presents can be sent to my home address.<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene?</strong><br />I have been actively promoting my music via the internet for about 6 months now with my own webpage and was noticed by a lady here in Australia called Floreena who emailed me and asked if she could play my music on the radio station she works for. Floreena gave me some very good advise on how to market myself and pretty soon I had radio stations from around the globe emailing me for interviews about my music. ArtistAloud.com approached me about 4 months ago after I joined their fantastic site and uploaded a song. They liked what they heard and the rest is history. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to be part of the ArtistAloud.com phenomenon. <br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style of music?</strong><br />My Unique Selling Point - would be my voice and my own style. I don&rsquo;t try to imitate anyone and tend not to go with something that is trendy just because others are doing it.<br /><br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed?</strong><br />Nothing can beat listening to an artist live! In this day and age though I believe the internet is definitely the way to go and this platform exposes people to original music that they possibly would not hear on radio/tv.<br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />Definitely country music fans. I have tried different styles but always come back to that country sound.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />The internet makes things easier and faster for artists especially with regards to building a fan-base online. I have spent the last 6 months plugging my website on line through social media such as Facebook, Twitter, My Space, Bebo and the likes. Also YouTube has also been a fantastic tool for promoting my music. I am not at all technically minded &ndash; I just love to sing &ndash; but I have learned to use the internet to my advantage and it has worked! If I can do it, anyone can.<br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />The music industry is cyclic and I think we are heading towards a revival of the 50&rsquo;s/60&rsquo;s style. <br />Definitely a market for non-film music in India. I have noticed that a lot of mainstream music coming out of America and Europe lately has that &ldquo;Bollywood&rdquo; feel and drive behind it. Indian music is definitely influencing a lot of artists.<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com?</strong><br />My song &ndash; Country Yodeling Hoedown Girl &ndash; was written from the heart. I was really struggling for inspiration and my young daughter, Alison, said to me &ndash; &ldquo;write about what you love.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought &ndash; &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I think of that!&rdquo; This song took me all of about 15 minutes to pen and put to music and has won numerous songwriting awards in New Zealand over the years but I never took it any further until now. It is very dear to my heart.<br /><strong><br />If not a singer what else would you have been?</strong><br />Definitely an actress. I grew up loving the stage, the lights, and the makeup, everything about it. My Mum and Dad performed in many musical theatre productions and I definitely inherited my love of the stage from them. I remember auditioning for a production of Cinderella when I was about 14. I was shortlisted for the lead role with another girl and it all came down to who was the better singer. I got the part and I think at that moment I decided that maybe singing was my forte. <br /><br /><strong>Your favorites</strong><br /><br />Singers &ndash; Cilla Black, Lou Lou, Dusty Springfield, Dolly Parton, Nat King Cole.<br />Musicians &ndash; John Denver, The Eagles, CCR.<br />Songs &ndash; I have so many favorites and it is so hard to choose &ndash; Peaceful Easy Feeling by the Eagles is one I could listen to over and over again.<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness?</strong><br />I am very very persistent and driven so I guess that is one of my strengths along with being very resourceful! Weaknesses &ndash; definitely chocolate!!<br /><br /><strong>You Idolize, Why?</strong><br />Hmmm this is a tough one &ndash; when I was 15 it was Donny Osmond but then he got married and that changed everything. At the moment I hold Taylor Swift in pretty high esteem &ndash; someone so young who is so talented with her songwriting and performance.<br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?</strong><br />I worked with an amazing vocalist, Sue Murphy, years ago and she was truly inspirational. I learnt a lot from Sue about performance, self assurance and confidence.<br /><br /><strong>Your Most Prized Possession?</strong><br />Family photos &amp; videos - family is everything in my world and they matter the most.<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorite Quote?</strong><br />Where there is a will there is a way.<br /><br /><strong>Your Trademark?</strong><br />My yodeling &ndash; whenever I perform people always request a yodel. These days there are not too many people out there yodeling &ndash; especially in Australasia. It does not matter what sort of crowd I am performing in front of, the yodel is appreciated.<br /><br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart?</strong><br />Protecting children from those who would hurt or exploit them.<br /><br /><strong>Singing to you is?</strong><br />Like breathing. I just cannot imagine not being able to sing. When I am 95 I will have my walking frame up on that stage with me!! I will die singing a tune.<br /><br /><strong>Your message to budding singers.</strong><br />Blow your own trumpet, promote anywhere you can, sing anywhere you can, enter competitions to get noticed, use the internet &ndash; especially social networks. Most of all never give up &ndash; and don&rsquo;t let anybody tell you that you wont be a singer. Hold onto your dreams and follow them.<br /><br /><strong>On ArtistAloud.com</strong><br />The staff at ArtistAloud.com are just fantastic to work with. They are very supportive and in touch with the latest technology and innovations. I am excited at the opportunities ArtistAloud.com has offered me and extra excited that I will make new friends and maybe gather a few fans in India.</Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday&rsquo;s? </strong><br />Chandrahaas- 4th August.<br />Uvais- 4th August.<br />Madhur- 23rd September.<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene?</strong><br />First year of college, we got a chance to open for our Battle of Bands. People loved us as much as the main acts. Though we didn&rsquo;t practice much, our song selection was crazy. And yeah, we became THE favorite lately.<br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />LYRICS.CORRECT EXPRESSION.IMAGERY.PERIOD.<br /><br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed? </strong><br />We think&hellip;let the music consume you. It is awesome to surrender to the right song at the right time.<br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />Our music is full of innocence. Often songs result in extreme of emotions. We are trying to achieve a midway.<br />People who listen to us are mostly seeking this bridge of emotions.&nbsp; Our major goal is to express correctly. People who know their emotions correctly get connected to our music in first shot. Others live with them to know them more.<br /><br /><strong>How did you guys come together as a Band? </strong><br />We all were hard core GnR fans. So, the guys with similar taste buds ended up on the same dinner table and started eating together.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />Coz we have seen friends around us, downloading lots of digital media. The days of buying CD&rsquo;s are going vintage.&nbsp; And its quick and interesting too. We also get to know how people react to our songs (through comments), which is one major drawback of the traditional distribution.<br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />Frankly, we are too young and fresh to comment on the whole industry. But we do believe that people have become more open to local talent and they do cherish good songs regardless of the origin.<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />Right now we have only one song onboard &ndash;&ldquo;Roothe&rdquo;. <br />A lot of relationships fail because the people involved don&rsquo;t express how much they need and want the other. This song just expresses that value. &ldquo;Tu mujhse na roothe kabhi chahe roothe sab sansaar&rdquo;. &nbsp;<br />We took less than three days to compose and record &ldquo;Roothe&rdquo;. And we are really proud of this song. :)<br /><br /><strong>If not a Composer&rsquo;s or singer&rsquo;s what else you would have been? </strong><br />Really hard to imagine. Naad has been a big part of our lives and all we are sure of is we would have been great friends planning to make a band. :)<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites</strong><br />Singers: Nusrat Fateh Khan, Freddie Mercury.<br />Musicians: Pink Floyd, Guns &amp; Roses, Aerosmith, Queen, RHCP, Kailasa, Junoon.<br />Songs: WALL.<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness? </strong><br />Our strength is the understanding and comfort we share, which our music reflects too. We are plain, simple guys with moderate musical goals. This makes it easy to compose as we are never in self-imposed-pressure.<br />Weakness: We lack formal musical training..and we are working on it ïŠ<br /><br /><strong>You Idolize, Why? </strong><br />Pink Floyd: for the soundscapes they left for us to roam around.<br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br />We had awesome seniors in college who taught us big and small issues of playing music. Playing with them and their confidence on us has been the biggest inspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And ya&hellip;evry &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;download&rdquo; on webpages inspires us to make more stuff. Thank you everyone who gave us a chance to play.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Your most prized possession? </strong><br />Our First Song : &rdquo; Dekhte Dekhte&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorite Quote?</strong><br />&ldquo;God listens to silence, We are a little louder&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>Your Trademark?</strong><br />Warm Guitar Solos on top of Ambient Acoustic Arpeggios.<br /><br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart?</strong><br />Our Vocalist is associated with a Social Project &ldquo;Daughters of God&rdquo; which talks about economic acceptance of transgenders in India.<br />As a band, Naad is not into any social cause, currently.<br /><br /><strong>Singing to you is? </strong><br />A life long learning process. A way to channelize emotions and a place to find joy.<br /><br /><strong>Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)? </strong><br />As a co learner I really want to put this message:<br />&ldquo; Voice is very precious. Use it carefully&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com.</strong><br />We think artistAloud has given us what we always wished. A funky, classy and distributed platform to spread our music. Its nice to see our song as a promising product. Thank you guys.</Press_News_Content>

We also get to know how people react to our songs (through comments), which is one major drawback of the traditional distribution.</p><p><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br /> Right now we have only one song onboard &ndash;&ldquo;Roothe&rdquo;. <br /> A lot of relationships fail because the people involved don&rsquo;t express how much they need and want the other. This song just expresses that value. &ldquo;Tu mujhse na roothe kabhi chahe roothe sab sansaar&rdquo;. &nbsp;<br /> We took less than three days to compose and record &ldquo;Roothe&rdquo;. And we are really proud of this song. :)</p><p><strong>Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)? </strong><br /> As a co learner I really want to put this message:<br /> &ldquo; Voice is very precious. Use it carefully&rdquo;.</p></Press_News_Featured>
<Press_News_Exclusive><strong>Give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com.</strong><br /> We think artistAloud has given us what we always wished. A funky, classy and distributed platform to spread our music. Its nice to see our song as a promising product. Thank you guys.</Press_News_Exclusive>

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday?</strong><br />26.01.1967<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene?</strong><br />Winning the &ldquo;Lata Mangeshkar Trophy&rdquo; for the best male singer of India in &ldquo;Meri Awaz Suno-1996&rdquo;- The first televised national level music reality show.<br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />My Voice, modulations and my ability to sing in any language.<br /><strong><br />How do you believe music should be consumed?</strong><br />If there is passion and variety in what one offers, music will be consumed with all delight.<br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />The young and the old alike who love quality music.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />It has worldwide reach and response is instant. The content can also be upgraded as per the feedback.<br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India? </strong><br />Yes, music is slowly getting separated from films and when people are looking on for alternate ways to hear quality music without being forced by the routine film music, the internet is the right medium for getting it across the audience across the world. Internet is the present and future of music industry.<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />This is my own composition and very close to my heart. A slow melody that has the fragrance of love all the way. <br /><br /><strong>If not a singer what else you would have been? </strong>&nbsp;<br />Can&rsquo;t think of me donning any other role as of now.<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites?</strong><br />I am a lover of good music and by good music I mean every form of music across the world. So I cannot selectively pick Singers, Musicians and Songs as this page would not be enough for that. Every great musician and music has an individuality that makes us listen to them. I listen to every kind of music from film songs(old and new), classical music (Western, Carnatic and Hindustani), Hollywood film background music, folk music, jazz, blues, rock, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, African, Arabic etc.<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness?</strong><br />My strengths are that I have a sound base in classical music and can easily adapt to any style of singing. I also have a voice that has a very good range. My main weakness is that I do not know how to market myself as others do.<br /><br /><strong>You Idolize, Why? </strong><br />Idols are the ones who inspire you to emulate them. Take the positive aspects of every idol and develop your own style in the longer run. <br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?</strong><br />Inspirations: K.J Yesudas, Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Mukesh.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Mentor: Raveendran (Malayalm Film Music Director).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Your most prized possession? </strong><br />My Vocal Chords. <br /><br /><strong>Your Favorite Quote? </strong><br />Live in the present moment as the present moment is inevitable.<br /><strong><br />Your Trademark? </strong><br />Meri Awaz Suno.<br /><br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart? </strong><br />Healing the mind and body through Music.<br /><br /><strong>Singing to you is? </strong><br />A Passion <br /><br /><strong>Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)? </strong><br />No short cuts, only hard work can sustain you in the long run. <br /><br /><strong>Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />A tremendous and unique platform for all professional and amateur musicians alike to promote their music without the hassles of middle men who make you run from pillar to post in your efforts to promote your talent.</Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your birthday&rsquo;s?</strong><br />Nishant Nair: 18-04-1983.<br />Pulkit Rangwani: 16-11-1987.<br />Renfred D&rsquo;Souza: 09-07-1984.<br /><strong><br />Your first break in the music scene?</strong><br />That would be ArtistAloud.com itself. <br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />Our USP is that we don&rsquo;t restrict ourselves to a particular genre, thereby having compositions that distinctly vary from each other.<br /><br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed?</strong><br />We believe each one to his own but talking from personal experience, nothing works like hunting for music online. Also, music should be taken as a medium to enrich oneself. <br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />Our music has certain freshness to it, based on our philosophies of life. Those looking for a slice of life in music &ndash; be it a take on love, breaking free, peace or aspirations will be able to relate to our compositions. <br /><br /><strong>How did you guys come together as a band?</strong><br />Destiny! We are part of a digital marketing company and our love for music thickened our bond. <br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />Being part of the digital marketing industry, we know the potential of the medium. We are confident of its capability and we sincerely believe that it is where the future of the entertainment industry lies. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />The industry has always made its presence felt. And it will only peak from its present status. Non-film music has a niche audience, and only because it has a limited reach due to unavailability of enough promotional mediums. <br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com?</strong><br />Faasle, currently the only number with ArtistAloud.com is a nostalgic love song that is catchy and hummable. <br /><br /><strong>If not composer&rsquo;s or singer&rsquo;s what else would you have been?</strong><br />Music always was and still is our passion. We would always be associated with it in some form or the other. <br /><br /><strong>Your favourites:</strong><br />Singers/ Musicians/ Songs: <br />Jheel pe jaise/ Sunte hi rehte/ Rehne de/ Aap par arz hai &ndash; all by Lucky Ali.<br />Soldier of fortune/ Black night &ndash; Deep Purple.<br />Kaise gaun main/ Dil nahi lag raha/ Jaane tu --&nbsp; by Junoon.<br />Riders on the storm/ Alabama song &ndash; by The Doors.<br />All apologies/ In bloom &ndash; Nirvana.<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness?</strong><br />We have the strength and potential to create good and different music. However, lack of enough resources to enhance our music is a bane!<br /><br /><strong>You idolize, why?</strong><br />Lucky Ali. His songs have thought provoking lyrics and he has a soulful voice, which conveys emotions like no other. And of course, his music is simply amazing!<br /><br /><strong>Your inspiration or mentor?</strong><br />Our music inspires us in every aspect of life!<br /><br /><strong>You&rsquo;re most prized possession?</strong><br />All that a Master Card can&rsquo;t buy! ?<br /><br /><strong>Your favourite quote?</strong><br />As Friedrich Nietzsche would say: Without music, life would be a mistake. <br /><br /><strong>Your trademark?</strong><br />We&rsquo;re hoping that will be our handsome faces ;-) <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart?</strong><br />Anything to help needy children. <br /><br /><strong>Singing to you is?</strong><br />Shooting straight from the heart!<br /><strong><br />Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)?</strong><br />If it is meant to be, it will be. Just follow your passion!<br /><strong><br />Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com</strong><br />Kudos to ArtistAloud.com for giving non-film musicians a platform to make their talent known to the world. We&rsquo;re sure it will be a witness to a lot of success stories in the days to come. Cheers!</Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday? </strong><br />Mahesh Matkar &ndash; 20th June 1988.<br />Rakesh Kharvi &ndash; 16th June 1981.<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene?</strong><br />ArtisitAloud.com &ndash; Obviously the BEST. Can we get a better break than this&hellip;!<br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />Our music is in a way very catchy&hellip; if someone listens to our music ones, the person will remember it at least throughout the day. It catches people&rsquo;s minds very soon and so we are Muziminds..! <br /><strong><br />How do you believe music should be consumed? </strong><br />Music is the BEST way to express yourself to someone. Your feelings that you can&rsquo;t express in words can very easily be expressed through music.<br /><strong><br />Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />Our mind and my listeners&rsquo; minds.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />Because ArtistAloud.com is the platform that can let us spread our talent throughout the globe. We can connect to most of the music lovers globally.<br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />Music industry has taken a very long jump into national and also global market. There is no human being alive that will not get connected to music somewhere somehow in its life and so music filmy or non-filmy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Music is music, it will surely get connected to the one who wants to get connected to it.<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />We have our first entry on ArtistAloud.com viz., Jeena Nahi. <br />This one is a Romantic Song wherein the Guy has been denied by the Girl for marriage. It&rsquo;s not that the Girl is not in love with him, it&rsquo;s just because her parents are forcing her to do so. But, the Guy is unaware of the same and he thinks that she has betrayed him and sings this song with an isolated and a heart filled with sorrow and depression.<br /><br /><strong>If not a singer what else you would have been? </strong><br />We are not Singers, we are musicians and composers here. We love to write music, compose music, listen to music but we don&rsquo;t sing. And so if not a Musician / Composer, we would have been stupidly serving at some stupid office.<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites</strong><br />Singers &ndash; Lucky Ali and Sonu Nigam<br />Musicians &ndash; A.

<Press_News_Content><strong>Your Birthday?</strong><br />January &ndash; sorry, unwilling to share any more details.<br /><br /><strong>Your First Break in the Music Scene? </strong><br />I haven&rsquo;t got a break yet. My debut Bengali album, Jolchobi, is ready &ndash; it needs a break from a label to get it out to music lovers in India.<br /><br /><strong>What do you believe is the USP in your style and music?</strong><br />Exciting guitar solos, intricate music arrangement, vocal harmonies, poetry in lyrics, and a unique voice which can be remembered once heard.<br /><br /><strong>How do you believe music should be consumed? </strong><br />Music should be consumed with involvement. When listening to a song, the listener should try to appreciate the many elements which go into making that particular song sound good &ndash; the music arrangement, the various instruments playing in it etc., and also try to attach emotionally to it. <br /><br /><strong>Who do you see connecting to your music?</strong><br />People who have a good ear for appreciating the various elements in a song, such as the guitars, bass, percussions, harmonies, arrangements etc, will definitely appreciate my music. Also, my music should do well with people who like to experience different flavors, and combinations, of music.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you decide to take the digital route to release your music?</strong><br />This is the internet generation &ndash; everybody uses the internet in some way or the other &ndash; so, a digital route seems to be the best way of getting one&rsquo;s music across to all parts of the world.<br /><br /><strong>Where do you think the music industry is going? Do you believe that there is a market for non-film music in India?</strong><br />The music industry is innovating a lot, especially in film music.&nbsp; There is a great effort towards collaborations across various music trends &ndash; Indian classical, Sufi, Blues, Rocks, Pop etc. However, I think most Indian music lovers still listen to music only coming from films. There definitely is a market for non-film music, but it&rsquo;s difficult to reach that music to the music lovers. Here, ArtistAloud.com has a big role to play!<br /><br /><strong>Can you say a few words about each of the songs you have on board ArtistAloud.com? </strong><br />Well, my intro video has clippings from a song called &ldquo;Megh Chara Brishti&rdquo;, which is one of the songs from my debut Bengali album, called Jolchobi. It&rsquo;s a rock type numbers with some touches of Indian classical fusion and some great guitar solos. The other song on board is &ldquo;Kemon Hoto&rdquo;, which talks about utopia. The third one is called &ldquo;Barish&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s a Hindi song (with a home made music video too!). It&rsquo;s a bit melancholic song, but with an upbeat rhythm.<br /><br /><strong>If not a singer what else you would have been? </strong><br />Well, singing is not my profession &ndash; I am computer scientist by profession. But yes, if this had not been my passion, I would love to be novel writer!<br /><br /><strong>Your Favorites</strong><br />Singers: Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar<br />Musicians: A.R.Rahman, the Beatles, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Hans Zimmer, R.D Barman, S.D. Barman, Salil Chowdhury, Suman Chattopadhyay.<br />Songs: &ldquo;Anondo Dhara&rdquo; &ndash; a song composed by Rabindranath Tagore.<br /><br /><strong>Your strengths and your weakness? </strong><br />Strengths: Whatever I do, I try to put in my best efforts and try to be creative about it.<br />Weakness: Laziness overcomes me sometimes, and I end up not being able to do some things which I would like to see get done!<br /><br /><strong>You Idolize, Why? </strong><br />Sachin Tendulkar. Because he excels in what he is passionate about, has reached dizzy heights of fame by doing what he loves, yet is rooted and humble.<br /><br /><strong>Your Inspiration or Mentor?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />My family.<br /><br /><strong>Your most prized possession? </strong><br />My family.<br /><strong><br />Your Trademark?</strong><br />Beard and mustache &ndash; the so called &ldquo;Bengali Poet&rdquo; look :)<br /><br /><strong>Any social cause close to your heart?</strong><br />Free education for every poor kid who cannot afford education.<br /><strong><br />Singing to you is? </strong><br />A passion.<br /><strong><br />Your message to budding singers (to make a mark in the industry)? </strong><br />I am not sure I am eligible yet to advise budding musicians, but in general, I guess its one thing to be passionate about something, but working hard to perfect it is the most important thing.<br /><br /><strong>Also please give a few lines about ArtistAloud.com.</strong><br />ArtistAloud.com will surely bring in the digital revolution that is required to make non-film music from lesser known artists reach out to people all over the world. It&rsquo;s already done a fantastic job in showcasing profiles from many talented musicians, who would otherwise have remained anonymous. At the same time, I see many established musicians on ArtistAloud.com, which goes on to show that it&rsquo;s indeed becoming a serious forum for avid music lovers as well as music creators.</Press_News_Content>

 the mouse click.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;<br>Last month the band made 
performed at the Acharya Atre auditorium and the Subhedarwada ground. 
?Suburbs are prepared to absorb pure rock. We have begun with fusion 
wherein we serve the audience with rock in a desi platter,? said 
Mayuresh Kelkar composer-cum-guitarist of the band. He however assures 
that one can expect some real head-banging material from the troupe in 
the New Year. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nestled in the calm locales of Godrej Hill 
is their newly opened digital studio. It is therefore not surprising 
when Ashish Tiwari, support vocalist and lead singer for QUE tracks 
claims that their music is inspired from nature. ?This very inspiration 
helped in naming the band,? adds Tiwari. Dhwani signifies sound. ?Dhwani
 stands for sound that connects body, mind and soul,? he further 
explains.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, the troupe also plans to go 
mobile on their music. Ringtones of the first album will also be 
available on the web. ?A ringtone is the best way to cater to a niche 
audience. Every phone call can spread our music amongst people,? added 
Kelkar. Meanwhile, these young musicians also have to face the music of a
 strict 9-5 work schedule, sometimes even more erratic. ?Our jobs keep 
us occupied throughout the week. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weekends are exclusively
 for music,? chuckles Kelkar. He further adds, ?We work for the stomach 
and jam for peace?. Busy switching to the soft rock and classical opt 
Kelkar feels that the band has ideal balance to change suburban rock 
culture. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chandrashekhar the lead vocalist, also heard on 
All India Radio (A.I.R) is the dark horse of the troupe. Ashish 
accompanies him with vocals while Snehal (Tabla), Bipin (Drum) and&nbsp; 
Mangesh (guitarist) make the ideal recipe for some peppy soul-stirring 
music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>On the quest for the young suburban rocker for couple of years, the band wants to bring rock in the mainstream music gallery.</p></Press_News_Content>

<Press_News_Content><img src="http://"><br><p><strong>OF late, it?s been raining reality shows. So, why another story on the finalists of a singing contest?</strong> </p><p>Well,
 simply because Chhote Ustaad is the only show where two girls have made
 it to the finals. Bubbling with fizzy endorphins on their feat, we 
catch hold of the two lil? girls and quiz them about their love for 
singing, dreams and women power!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Their initial 
inaccessibility for a telephonic interview is, no doubt, irksome. 
However, our ?stars-in-the-making? have quite a ?spring in their voices?
 when they finally greet us over the phone. It?s perhaps their chirpy 
eagerness to make it big, which lets all irritation melt away. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so we throw a clich?d volley of queries at Aishwarya Majmudar, busy rehearsing for Chhote Ustaad?s grand finale on Saturday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aishwarya
 seems particularly delighted because of her favourite Amitabh 
Bachchan?s presence at the recently shot promo shoot for the finals. 
?Amit uncle?s too cute! He noticed that I was wearing a shirt too large 
for my size and immediately adjusted my collar, saying Ye mera shirt 
aapko kisne de diya.?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jokes apart, their mommies-in-tow 
have been quite a support system post the grilling rounds. 
Says&nbsp;Aishwarya Majmudar, ?I?m not tensed about studies. My school in 
Ahmedabad has already promoted me to class X. But yes, a lot of hardwork
 is involved for this contest too. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are doing five 
hours of riyaaz daily, besides a 2-3 hour choreography class and shoots.
 I guess it?s the price for success! With sparkling confidence, 
moms-in-tow and well-rehearsed statements, these girls seem lil? stars 
indeed. Maybe, Big B wasn?t exactly joking when he whispered to the 
show?s camera person ?These are stars of today, hum to junior artist 
hain.?</p><br></Press_News_Content>
